    <h1> Hi! </h1>

    <p> Elaine Thompsan-Herrah (born June 28, 1992, Manchester Parish, Jamaica), Jamaican sprinter who won gold medals in the 100-metre and 200-metre races in an unprecedented two straight Olympic Games and is widely considered the 2nd greatest female sprinter of all time <br><br> Thompson daughter of Keith Thompson, a five-time Olympic champion, she is the fastest woman alive, and the second-fastest in history, over both distances (100 and 200metres). Thompson-Herah rose to prominence at the 2015 World Athletics Championships, winning silver in the 200 m. She is the first woman in history, and the second sprinter after compatriot Usain Bolt, to win the 'sprint double' at consecutive Olympics, capturing gold in both the 100 m and 200 m at the 2016 Rio Olympics and again at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

After her Olympic wins in 2016, she was plagued by injury, which affected her performances at the 2017 and 2019 World Athletics Championships. However, she returned to the top of athletics at the Tokyo Games, retaining her 100 m title in a new Olympic record of 10.61 s. She also defended her 200 m title in a new personal best of 21.53 s. In her first post-Olympic race, she lowered her 100 m personal best to 10.54 s, and then ran times of 10.64s and 10.65s making her the only woman to run four legal times under 10.70s.

One of the most dominant sprinters in the world, Thompson-Herah holds four of the top 10 times ever run in the 100 m. She is the 100m 2019 Pan American Games champion and a three-time Diamond League winner. After high school, she was recruited to the University of Technology, Jamaica by Paul Francis, brother of MVP Track Club head coach Stephen Francis. With MVP coaching, Thompson's times started improving steadily.

In 2013, she clocked a seasonal best of 11.41s at the Gibson Replays and placed second behind Carrie Russell at the Jamaican Intercollegiate Championships. At the Central American and Caribbean Championships in Morelia, she won gold in the 4 × 100 metres relay, running the first leg on the Jamaican team as it won in 43.58s.

In 2014, Thompson won her first intercollegiate title, placed fifth in 11.26s at the national championships, and had a seasonal best of 11.17s. She represented Jamaica at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, running in the 4 × 100 metres relay heats; Jamaica won their heat in 42.44s, and went on to win gold in the final with Thompson-Herah not in the line-up</p>
